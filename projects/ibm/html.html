		<p>At IBM Security, I’ve contributed to finding gaps in technologies and finding as-is pain-points in various products.</p>
		<p>With the gathered information, I would collaborate with engineers and designers to create new solutions. This includes improving interfaces as well as inventing methods to gather better and more relevant information for users.</p>
		<p>As cybersecurity is one of my hobbies, I had the honor of being the central conduit between the application development team, security engineers, and designers. In this position, I closed communication gaps and educated others via stories and metaphors.</p>
