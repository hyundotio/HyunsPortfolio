		<p class="scroll-hide scroll-hidden">In early 2012, the Camden campus of Rutgers University where I studied graphic design came under fire. Seemingly out of the blue, Governor Chris Christie endorsed a plan to overhaul the higher education system in New Jersey. Part of the plan called for my school to be divorced from the Rutgers family and merged with Rowan University. Worse yet, the governor's plan was utterly lacking in detail. Many students, parents, and alumni weren’t aware of his plan, so I decided to start a campaign against it.</p>
		<p class="scroll-hide scroll-hidden">For the R2RMerge movement, I created the original identity and initial collateral which included a website and poster. The movement went on to include many students, alumni, staff, and other contributors from the Rutgers University campus and related organizations.</p>

		<p class="scroll-hide scroll-hidden">After months of hard work, we made lasting change. "We did it," was the last message I sent out to the 14,000+ people who’d participated in the movement. The Senate, No. 2063 State of New Jersey 215th Legislature was signed and the campus of Rutgers Camden was prevented from merging with Rowan University.</p>
