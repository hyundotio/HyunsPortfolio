		<p class="scroll-hide scroll-hidden">We have seen the pictures of the distant and impersonal catastrophe before, but I wanted to know what normal life there had been like before the accident. I wanted to know what kinds of stoves families used to cook dinner. I wanted to know what books were stacked on their night stands. There's more to the exclusion zone than the disaster itself.</p>
		<p class="scroll-hide scroll-hidden">For the moments I couldn't capture, I asked my mom, a painter, to recreate them. The paintings in the book are my input filtered through her artistic lens. As I roamed the zone, I also found beautiful typography, artwork, and designs in general. I asked a friend to reinterpret a portion of the artwork through digital illustration. For typography and packaging, I took a stab at recreating them digitally. I didn't want to take anything out of the zone, as that's not safe, and is certainly not respectful. The recreations in this book are my way of preserving what I found without disturbing the places I visited.</p>
		<p class="scroll-hide scroll-hidden">tak.. isn't meant for historical, political, or technical reference. Those topics have been covered extensively in great works you can find online. The book is just a humble record of my trip to Chernobyl, written down and distributed in hopes of teaching somebody something new.</p>
